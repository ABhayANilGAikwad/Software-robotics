# Automated Messaging Bot

## 1. Introduction

Communication is critical for organizations today. Sending bulk messages manually over email and WhatsApp consumes time and results in human errors.

Our project, the **Automated Messaging Bot**, utilizes **Automation Anywhere Community Edition** to automate the process of sending customized messages to multiple users based on data sourced from a Microsoft Excel file. This solution ensures fast, reliable, and efficient communication, minimizing human intervention and potential errors.

## 2. Motivation

Educational institutions and companies often face challenges when disseminating information such as event invites, reminders, or important notifications to a large audience. Manually composing and sending individual messages becomes impractical and resource-intensive when dealing with hundreds or thousands of recipients.

Automating these messaging tasks significantly reduces human effort, ensures timely and accurate communication, and ultimately increases operational efficiency. This bot aims to address the limitations of manual communication processes.

## 3. Problem Statement

Manual communication processes are inherently:

* **Time-consuming and tedious**, requiring significant human effort for large recipient lists.
* **Prone to errors**, such as incorrect email addresses, typos, or missed recipients.
* **Inefficient for large participant lists**, making timely mass communication challenging.

Therefore, there is a clear need for an automated bot that can:

* **Read** participant details (Name, Mobile Number, and Email Address) directly from an Excel file.
* **Send** personalized messages through both Email (via SMTP) and WhatsApp (via web automation).
* Operate with **minimal human intervention**, streamlining the entire communication process.

## 4. Brief Description

The Automated Messaging Bot operates through the following steps:

1.  **Data Extraction:** The bot begins by reading an Excel file that contains a structured list of participants, including their Name, Mobile Number, and Email Address.
2.  **Personalized Email Communication:** For each participant, the bot composes a customized email message (potentially including their name or other relevant details) and sends it via a configured SMTP server (e.g., Gmail).
3.  **Personalized WhatsApp Communication:** The bot then interacts with WhatsApp Web (or potentially utilizes `wa.me` links for direct messaging) to send personalized WhatsApp messages to each participant using their mobile number.
4.  **Logging:** Throughout the process, the bot maintains logs to track the success or failure of each email and WhatsApp message sent. This provides valuable insights into the communication delivery status.
5.  **Resource Management:** Upon completion of the messaging tasks, the bot ensures that all utilized resources (e.g., browser sessions, Excel files) are properly closed.
6.  **Scalability and Reliability:** The design of this system prioritizes scalability to handle varying numbers of recipients and aims for reliable message delivery through automation.

## 5. Tools Used

| Tool/API                     | Purpose                                                                 |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Automation Anywhere** | Main automation platform for bot creation and execution.                |
| **Microsoft Excel** | Input source containing participant details.                            |
| **SMTP Server (e.g., Gmail)** | Protocol used for sending email communication.                         |
| **Web Browser (e.g., Chrome)** | Used to access and interact with WhatsApp Web for message automation. |
| **WhatsApp API (wa.me links)** | (Optional) Potentially used for sending messages through browser links. |
| **Python (optional)** | (Optional) May be used for additional scripting or complex logic.       |
| **AA360 Bot Assistant Chrome Extension** | Tool used to copy and paste bot content between Community Edition environments. |

## 6. Objectives

* **Automate** bulk messaging tasks for email and WhatsApp.
* **Ensure** timely and error-free delivery of personalized messages.
* **Minimize** human workload associated with manual communication.
* **Create** a reusable and scalable communication framework for future use.
* **Facilitate sharing of the bot** between Automation Anywhere Community Edition environments.

## 7. Why Automation?

* **Speed:** Send hundreds of messages within minutes, significantly faster than manual methods.
* **Accuracy:** Eliminate human typing errors and ensure consistent message delivery.
* **Scalability:** Efficiently handles large datasets of recipients extracted from Excel.
* **Consistency:** Maintain a uniform messaging format and delivery process across all recipients.
* **Efficiency:** Reduce the manual workload on human resources, allowing them to focus on more strategic tasks.
* **Shareability (via Bot Assistant):** Enables the transfer of the bot logic to other Community Edition users.

## 8. Accessing and Importing the Bot using Bot Assistant

Since Automation Anywhere Community Edition does not offer direct bot export/import, you can use the **AA360 Bot Assistant Chrome Extension** to share and access this bot:

### Exporting the Bot Content (Source Environment):

1.  **Install the AA360 Bot Assistant Chrome Extension:** Ensure this extension is installed in your Chrome browser.
2.  **Navigate to the "Automated Messaging Bot"** within your Automation Anywhere Community Edition Control Room.
3.  **Open the bot** in either "View" or "Edit" mode.
4.  **Launch the Bot Assistant Chrome Extension.** Click on the extension icon in your browser toolbar.
5.  Go to the **"Tools"** tab within the Bot Assistant.
6.  Click the **"Copy to clipboard"** button. The bot's entire content will be copied as JSON to your system's clipboard. **Share this copied JSON content with the user who wants to access the bot.**

### Importing the Bot Content (Target Environment):

1.  **Install the AA360 Bot Assistant Chrome Extension:** Ensure this extension is installed in the Chrome browser of the user who wants to import the bot.
2.  **Log in to their Automation Anywhere Community Edition Control Room.**
3.  **Navigate to the "Bots" or "Automation" section.**
4.  **Create a new Task Bot.** Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Automated Messaging Bot - Imported").
5.  **Open the newly created Task Bot** in "Edit" mode.
6.  **Launch the Bot Assistant Chrome Extension.**
7.  Go to the **"Tools"** tab.
8.  **Paste the JSON content** that was shared with you into the **text area** within the Bot Assistant.
9.  Click the **"Patch Content"** button. You should see a "success" message.
10. **Refresh** the browser page where the bot is open in the Control Room. The bot will now be populated with the actions and logic of the "Automated Messaging Bot."

### Running the Bot (Target Environment):

Once the bot content is successfully imported:

1.  Ensure that the necessary prerequisites are configured in this Automation Anywhere environment, such as:
    * Access to the Excel file (the file path in the bot might need to be updated if it's different).
    * Configured SMTP server details (within the Email actions).
    * A working web browser session for WhatsApp Web automation (the user might need to log in to WhatsApp Web).
    * Correct configuration for `wa.me` link generation (if used).
    * Python interpreter configuration (if Python scripts are used).
2.  Navigate to the imported bot in the Control Room.
3.  Select the bot and click the "Run," "Execute," or play button.
4.  Follow any prompts for input (e.g., Excel file path).
5.  Monitor the bot's execution in the Control Room.
6.  Review the logs generated by the bot to verify successful message delivery.

This method allows you to effectively share and access bot logic between different Automation Anywhere Community Edition instances, overcoming the lack of direct export/import functionality. Remember that the functionality of the Bot Assistant extension is maintained by its developer.
