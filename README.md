# üöÄ **Automated Messaging Bot**

## üìå **Introduction**

Communication is crucial for organizations today. Sending bulk messages manually via email and WhatsApp is both **time-consuming** and **error-prone**.

Our project, the **Automated Messaging Bot**, leverages **Automation Anywhere Community Edition** to automate sending **customized messages** to multiple users based on data sourced from a Microsoft Excel file. This solution ensures fast, **reliable**, and **efficient communication**, minimizing human intervention and potential errors.

## üí° **Motivation**

Educational institutions and businesses often face challenges when distributing **information** like event invites, reminders, or important updates to large audiences. Manually composing and sending individual messages becomes impractical, especially with hundreds or thousands of recipients.

By automating these tasks, we reduce human effort, ensure **timely and accurate** communication, and increase operational efficiency. This bot is designed to solve these challenges by streamlining the messaging process.

## üöß **Problem Statement**

Manual communication processes often lead to:

- **Time consumption:** Requires significant effort for large recipient lists.
- **Human error:** Incorrect email addresses, typos, or missed recipients.
- **Inefficiency:** Mass communication becomes slow and error-prone for large participant lists.

Therefore, the need for an automated messaging bot becomes clear:

- **Read** participant details from an Excel file.
- **Send** personalized messages via Email (using SMTP) and WhatsApp (via web automation).
- Operate with **minimal human intervention**, ensuring **scalable** and **reliable** communication.

## üìù **Brief Description**

The **Automated Messaging Bot** operates through the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction**  
   - Reads participant details (Name, Mobile Number, Email) from an Excel file.
  
2. **Personalized Email Communication**  
   - Composes a customized email for each participant and sends it using SMTP (e.g., Gmail).
  
3. **Personalized WhatsApp Communication**  
   - Sends personalized WhatsApp messages using the WhatsApp Web or `wa.me` links.
  
4. **Logging**  
   - Tracks the success or failure of each message, providing insights on delivery status.
  
5. **Resource Management**  
   - Ensures proper cleanup of resources like browser sessions and Excel files after execution.
  
6. **Scalability and Reliability**  
   - Designed to handle large recipient lists and deliver messages efficiently.
